# SCSS

Css file is compiled by VSCode extension 'LiveSass Compiler' with these settings :
```
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": null,
            "savePathReplacementPairs": null
        }
    ],  
    "liveSassCompile.settings.includeItems": [
        "/stigmeria.scss",
    ],
```

# BGA Options / Preferences format

Written in PHP with many constants.
Read by the game at setup and later by Preferences module.
Erased in JSON by BGA commit/build, so we keep the php in modules/php

So we can easily regenerate the JSON version (now included in the workspace) from PHP version with these steps :

- call the chat debug function `debug_JSON()`
- then browser inspect the notif and copy its DOM content. 
- then copy this JSON to the json file 
- send the json file to distant BGA folder via FTP
- Manage game : reload options (this will use the php options version)

# Game schemas

Schemas (from 1 to 49) are defined as text to generate image and avoid waste of space in img folder, + it allow us to define any unofficial schema we may want.

See the list `getTypes()` in [Schemas.php](/modules/php/Managers/Schemas.php).

Run the debug function `debug_playableSchemas()` to see which schema is playable in which mode.
