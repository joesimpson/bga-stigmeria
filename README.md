# SCSS

Css file is compiled by VSCode extension 'LiveSass Compiler' with these settings :
```
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": null,
            "savePathReplacementPairs": null
        }
    ],  
    "liveSassCompile.settings.includeItems": [
        "/stigmeria.scss",
    ],
```

# BGA Options / Preferences format

Written in PHP with many constants.
Read by the game at setup and later by Preferences module.
Erased in JSON by BGA commit/build, so we keep the php in modules/php

So we can easily update the JSON version (now included in the workspace) by 
- deleting the json file in distant BGA folder via FTP (keep it in local workspace)
- Edit the file `gameoptions.inc.php` to use the right path  ```require_once 'modules/php/constants.inc.php';```
- Copy the file `gameoptions.inc.php` to distant root folder of the project (it won't be build/deployed at this place)
- Manage game : reload options (this will use the php options version)
- call the tchat debug function `debugJSON()`
- then browser inspect the notif and copy its DOM content. 
- then copy this JSON to the json file 
- ( remove the first keys coming from BGA framework, if not already auto removed by the function )
